Q. What is programming language ?
	A language to communicate with computer for doing a particular task?
	
	print("Hello World")
	
	Computer will be understanding only 0 and 1 	
	
	2+3 = 5 
	
	Computer will be understanding only machine language
			
	programming language -> developers 
	converting the programming language to machine language -> compiler 
	who will be providing this compiler -> Python Package 

=> High Level 
Programming Language  				Machine Language 
Human can easily understand			Human will not be able to understand easily 

High Level Language 				low level language 
Very close to human 				very close to computer 

=> Open Source 
Any think which will be is open source 

==> Interpreted -> converting line by line 

I am learning Python // line1 -> machine language 
I have learned java // line2 -> machine language 
I want to learn c++

Compiled Language -> convert all the lines all together
I am learning Python 
I have learned java 
I want to learn c++

===> Convetional programming
